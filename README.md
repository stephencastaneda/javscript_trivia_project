# JavaScript Trivia Project üìö ¬†

## User Story

* As a user I should be asked 10 multiple choice trivia questions
* As a user I should see 4 answer options for each question 
* As a user I should see a progress bar at the top of the screen that updates as I progress through the questions
* As a user I should hear a sound that plays everytime I answer a question wrong
* As a user I should hear a sound that plays everytime I answer a question right
* As a user when I am finished the test, I should see my score printed as a percentage 
* As a user when I am finished the test, I should see a button that says ‚ÄúReset‚Äù and be able to take the quiz again

## Stretch Goals

* As a user, I should see a previous button that is only available when there‚Äôs a previous question. 
* As a user, when I click the previous button, I will go back to the previous question.
* As a user, when I click the previous button, if I originally clicked a correct answer, that will remove the correct answer from the score.
* As a user, I should see a working timer for each question.
* As a user, when my time expires for a question, the question is counted as wrong.
